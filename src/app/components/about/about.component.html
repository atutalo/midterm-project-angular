    <p>
      Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent
      trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and
      sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a
      constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies. Jack's first love
      was the sea, his second, his beloved ship the Black Pearl.
